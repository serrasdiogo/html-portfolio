<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Diogo and I am from Vila de Rei, Portugal.
  I work as a IT technician, but I want more and new challenges for me so I took a course at Udemy to start programming and I hope that helps me to becoming a Web Developer. 
</p>

<p>When I have free time, I like to listen to music, read or pratice some sports.
  Lately, I find a strength inside my body to pursuit this path to learn more about myself and my passions. 
</p>

<p>I hope that my future come more and more brighter for me. I promisse to fight for it and maybe help some others to achive their own.
  God bless you, and count on me if you need some help. You can find my contacts <a href="../public/contact.html">here.</a>
